TEST NOTES.

The three basic concepts of OOP/Object Oriented Programming. LIST THREE.
-Encapsulation: public / private.

-Inheritance: 

-Polymorphism:

Chapter 11 (Inheritence)

	- Inheritance "is-a" and Composition "has-a"
	- public, private, and protected Inheritance. KNOW THEM AND THE TABLE; TF PROTECTED MEMBER DIFFERENCE FROM PRIVATE
	-How to call base class functions from derived class // SHAPES NOTES ON MOODLE!!!!
	-Function Overriding. //OVERLOAD FUNCTION IN DERIVED CLASS. 
	-How are base class constructors invoked in derived class
	-Trace and/or write code on inhertiance and composition. 

	Operator Overloading (check the fraction class)

	-write code on overloading an operator
	-determine which operator from the class is called when called in main (or anywhere else)

What are friend functions? p 898 - 903
	-declared within class
	-technically not a member function (not called through object)
	-although not a member function, it can access private members of the objects.

Pointers p.818 - 847

	-Declare a pointer
	-assign an address to a pointer (legal assignment of pointers)
	-How do we dereference a pointer and what does it mean to dereference a pointer.!!!
	-Understand what actions new and delete perform. !!!!!!!!! Define and know what they DO. 
		NEW= ALLOCATES::::::: DELETE: DEALLOCATES

	-Understand memory leak and what are the issues !!!!!!!!!
		::KNOW DEFINITION::::::

	-understand dangling pointers and what the issues.

	-understand the difference between deep copy and shallow copy !!!!!
			:: SHALLOW COPY : copies locations. TWO POINTERS POINT TO SAME MEM LOCATION
			:: TWO VALUES = deep copy.

	-Resize a 1D and 2D array.
